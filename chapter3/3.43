1. 10, 20, 30 after exchange, will be:
10, 20, 30
10, 30, 20
20, 10, 30
20, 30, 10
30, 10, 20
30, 20, 10

2. 10 <-> 20 <-> 30
if we exchange 10, 20, and other process exchange 20 and 30, so:
10 <-> 20 --> 20, 10
but when 10 <-> 20, we exchange 20 <-> 30
30 <-> 20, then 20 is change to 10, 
so the result is: 20, 10, 10
