(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
  
  when we accumulate (+ 4 5), the step is:
  (inc (+ 3 5))
  (inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
  (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
  (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
    so it's a recursive progress.
    
  (define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
    
  when we accumulate (+ 4 5), the step is:
  (+ 3 (inc 5))
  (+ 2 (inc 6))
  (+ 1 (inc 7))
  (inc 8)
  (9)
    so it's a interaction progress,because the + save the (3, (inc 5)) result, not wait the (inc 5) accumulate the result.
